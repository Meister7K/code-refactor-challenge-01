# code-refactor-challenge-01

## Description

- This project was created to make the current website more user friendly to those with disabilities and may need to use additional tools such as screen readers. 
-This project adjusted non-semantic HTML tags with more descriptive tags such as 'div' to 'section' or 'aside', and including 'alt' attributes within 'image' tags.

- This project also cleaned up some repetitive CSS within the stylesheet. 

- Overall, it was learned that there is more than one way to create a website. However, there are always new/better practices that can be implemented to older code. Take the rtime to review and reflect on your work and see if there are ways to make it either more user friendly, or cleaner and less repetitive.
